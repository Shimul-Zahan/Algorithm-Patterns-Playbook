The two-pointer technique is a popular approach in problem-solving, especially for array and string manipulation tasks. It involves using two indices (or pointers) to traverse a data structure simultaneously, often from opposite ends or from a particular start point. This technique is highly efficient for problems that require finding pairs or specific subarrays that meet a condition because it often reduces the time complexity from 
ùëÇ(ùëõ^2)
O(n^2) (for nested loops) to 
ùëÇ(ùëõ)
O(n).

How It Works:
Initialization: Two pointers are set at strategic positions, either at both ends of the array or both starting at the beginning.
Traversal: Based on the conditions set in the problem, the pointers move towards each other (e.g., left to right and right to left) or in a specific direction.
Decision Making: The movement of the pointers depends on comparing elements at these pointers to achieve the desired result or condition, such as finding a pair that sums to a target or checking if a sequence is palindromic.
Example Problem: Finding a Pair that Sums to a Target
Problem: Given a sorted array, find if there exists a pair of numbers that adds up to a specific target sum.

Solution:

Step 1: Place one pointer at the beginning (left) and the other at the end (right) of the array.
Step 2: Check if the sum of the elements at these pointers equals the target:
If the sum is equal, you‚Äôve found the pair.
If the sum is less than the target, move the left pointer one step right (to increase the sum).
If the sum is more than the target, move the right pointer one step left (to decrease the sum).
Step 3: Repeat this process until the pointers meet or the pair is found.
Example:

Array: [1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 15]
Target Sum: 15
Steps:

Start with left = 0 (points to 1) and right = 5 (points to 15).
1 + 15 = 16 (greater than 15), so move the right pointer left.
1 + 11 = 12 (less than 15), so move the left pointer right.
4 + 11 = 15 (equal to target). Solution found: (4, 11).
When to Use:
The two-pointer technique is most useful for:

Sorted arrays, as it allows for binary search-like efficiency.
Problems with conditions involving pairs, subarrays, or partitions.
Tasks involving palindromes, duplicate removal, and merging intervals.
This technique is efficient in time and space complexity, making it a powerful tool for various algorithmic problems.
