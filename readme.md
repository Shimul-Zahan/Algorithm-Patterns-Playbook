## Techniques Overview

Each section contains an overview of the pattern, a description of common use cases, and links to example problems with explanations.

### Two Pointer Technique
Two pointers allow for efficient solutions by using two indices to traverse the data, often from different directions.

- **When to Use**: Arrays, linked lists, and problems involving pairs or partitions.
- **Common Problems**:
  - Remove duplicates from a sorted array
  - Container with most water
  - Three-sum problem
- [Examples & Solutions](./TwoPointer/)

### Sliding Window
The sliding window technique helps handle problems requiring tracking a subset of elements in an array or string.

- **When to Use**: Subarrays, substrings, or any fixed/variable-sized window problems.
- **Common Problems**:
  - Maximum sum subarray of size K
  - Longest substring without repeating characters
  - Minimum window substring
- [Examples & Solutions](./SlidingWindow/)

### Binary Search
Binary search is used on sorted data to find an element's position or make efficient decisions in logarithmic time.

- **When to Use**: Sorted arrays, binary trees, or any range-based search.
- **Common Problems**:
  - Find an element in a sorted array
  - First and last position of an element in sorted array
  - Find the square root of a number
- [Examples & Solutions](./BinarySearch/)

### Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming (DP) is an optimization technique to solve problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing results.

- **When to Use**: Problems with optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems, like recursive problems.
- **Common Problems**:
  - Fibonacci sequence
  - Longest common subsequence
  - 0/1 Knapsack
- [Examples & Solutions](./DynamicProgramming/)

### Divide and Conquer
Divide and conquer divides a problem into subproblems, solves them independently, and combines their results.

- **When to Use**: Recursive solutions that can be divided, like sorting and searching.
- **Common Problems**:
  - Merge sort
  - Quick sort
  - Search in rotated sorted array
- [Examples & Solutions](./DivideAndConquer/)

### Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each step to find a global optimum.

- **When to Use**: Problems that allow local optimization with globally optimal results.
- **Common Problems**:
  - Activity selection problem
  - Fractional knapsack
  - Huffman coding
- [Examples & Solutions](./GreedyAlgorithms/)

### Backtracking
Backtracking explores all possible solutions and backtracks when a solution path fails.

- **When to Use**: Problems with multiple possible configurations, like combinations and permutations.
- **Common Problems**:
  - N-Queens problem
  - Permutations of a string
  - Sudoku solver
- [Examples & Solutions](./Backtracking/)

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS explores nodes in layers, often used in tree and graph traversals to find the shortest path.

- **When to Use**: Trees and graphs where shortest path or layer-based traversal is required.
- **Common Problems**:
  - Shortest path in an unweighted graph
  - Level order traversal of a tree
  - Minimum steps to reach a target
- [Examples & Solutions](./BFS/)

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
DFS explores as far as possible down a path before backtracking, useful in graphs and trees.

- **When to Use**: Graph or tree problems that require exploring all nodes or paths.
- **Common Problems**:
  - Connected components in a graph
  - Path sum in binary tree
  - Island counting in a matrix
- [Examples & Solutions](./DFS/)

### Linked List Manipulation
Working with linked lists requires specific techniques due to their linear node structure.

- **When to Use**: Problems with linked lists where pointer manipulation is required.
- **Common Problems**:
  - Reverse a linked list
  - Detect cycle in a linked list
  - Merge two sorted linked lists
- [Examples & Solutions](./LinkedListManipulation/)
